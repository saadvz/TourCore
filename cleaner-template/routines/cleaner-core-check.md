# Routine: Cleaner Core Check

Wakes the cleaning Grok Bot on a schedule. It re-reads the host's calendars,
so a new, moved, or removed stay reaches the host without anyone asking "check
my calendars". It also sends any reminder that is due. This is the cleaning
bot's routine, not Tour Core's.

## Trigger

Scheduled. Every 5 minutes for a demo, and hourly otherwise. It carries no
webhook address, no key, and no secret.

## Instructions for the routine

1. If the host uses Google Calendar, read it with your own Google Calendar
   connector. Read only the calendar the host named at setup when you asked
   which Google calendar holds the bookings. Never the primary calendar unless
   the host says the bookings live there. Read from 7 days ago to 60 days
   ahead, with recurring events expanded into single events. Starting 7 days
   back keeps a stay that ends today in the read.
2. Call `check_now` with `{ timeZone, items }` as `googleEvents`, exactly as
   you read it from only that calendar. Don't edit, filter, or add to the
   events.
3. If the Google read failed, call `check_now` without `googleEvents`. Never
   send an empty list for a failed read. An empty list tells Cleaner Core
   every stay was removed.
4. Post each line in `alerts` in your own short words. Post nothing when
   `alerts` is empty.
   - A new booking names the stay and the usual times. When the host says yes,
     call `confirm_times` with those times.
   - "Have the guests left?" is the checkout nudge. Ask the host. Only the
     host's yes in chat sends the door code, with `mark_guests_left`. The nudge
     arrives at the next Check routine run after checkout time.
   - When an alert says a cleaning offer or reminder may not have gone out,
     ask the host whether to send it again. Only the host's yes in chat
     resends it, with `retry_send`.
5. Read every item in `messages`. Tell the host in your own words when one
   needs them: running late, a question, a problem, supplies, an arrival
   time, a decline, STOP, or an injury. Stay quiet on routine replies.
   When a message sounds like a problem that could stop the cleaning, tell
   the host right away, quote it, and ask whether to pause the cleaning.
   Cleaner Core never pauses on its own. Only the host's yes in chat pauses
   it, with `hold_job`.
6. When a message gives an arrival time, call `save_arrival` with it as 24-hour
   HH:MM, like 11:30.
7. If a message needs a reply, draft one and offer it to the host. Don't send
   it from the routine. It goes out with `send_message` only after the host's
   yes in chat.
8. If the reply has `completed`, call `get_job_photos`, look at the photos, and
   compare them with the checklist. Summarize the cleaning in your own words:
   arrival, start and done times, checklist, what the photos show, and notes.
9. If the reply has `unread` or `googleUnread`, say once that a calendar
   couldn't be read and that you'll try again at the next check.
10. If the reply has `needsTimes`, ask the host for the checkout time and the
    next check-in time, then call `confirm_times` with each as 24-hour HH:MM.
11. Never show a door code, an id, or a phone number.

## How the host enters a stay

Ask the host to enter each stay as a timed event, from the check-in time to
the checkout time. An all-day Google event ends on the day after its last day,
so an all-day stay would read as checking out a day late.

## Connecting it

Grok creates this routine itself after Activate, when `get_state` asks for
the routines. It needs no secret. The Alerts routine's address and key go to
Cleaner Core only through its one-time upload link, never in chat.

## Allowed tools

`check_now`, `confirm_times`, `get_state`, `save_arrival`, and
`get_job_photos`.
