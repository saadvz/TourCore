/**
 * How this Tour Core is installed and who runs it.
 *
 *  LOCAL_DEVELOPER    a developer's own computer: `npm run setup`, a local
 *                     browser, a manual tunnel and `.env`. The default.
 *  GROK_MANAGED_P0    installed and run by Grok on its own cloud computer
 *                     (`npm run bootstrap:grok`). A temporary demo, not the
 *                     hosted product.
 *  SELF_HOSTED        already running at a stable https address the operator
 *                     runs; Grok only connects and drives configuration.
 *  HOSTED_RAILWAY_P0  one Tour Core service we run on Railway for the demo.
 *                     Landlords do not create Railway projects. Single-tenant:
 *                     Marketplace publication requires tenant isolation.
 *
 * The mode changes how the installation is set up and reached, never a tour,
 * policy or access rule.
