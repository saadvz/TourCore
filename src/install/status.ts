 * Where this installation stands, component by component, in one

 * here (not in Grok's instructions): `nextStep` is the one thing to do now,
 * who does it, what to say to the operator, and (separately) what Grok needs
 * to know to do it. Whether a component is required or optional is decided
 * here too, never by the agent.
 *
 * Canonical P0 order:
 *   runtime → public connection → Grok connection → visitor texting
 *   → first property → operator alerts (recommended) → readiness
 *   → practice tour → publish (explicit yes) → operate
 *   → offer another property (the published one stays published)
 *
 * Copy rules: `operatorMessage`, `summary` and `lines` are safe to say to a
 * landlord as-is (no URLs, ports, commands, tool counts or protocol names).
 * Anything technical is in `grokInstructions` / `technical`, for Grok's own
 * actions and troubleshooting only.
