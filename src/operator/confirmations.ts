/**
 * Explicit operator approval for consequential actions (publish, pausing or
 * resuming a tour, calling one off, adding an approved fact). The first call
 * returns the exact question to ask and a short code bound to that action,
 * that target and the current state. Only a second call carrying the code
 * does the work, and only if nothing changed in between. Codes are single
 * use, expire quickly and live only in this process, so a restart simply
 * means asking again.
