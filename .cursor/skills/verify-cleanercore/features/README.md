# Cleaner Core verification map

This directory is the maintained source for verifying Cleaner Core's user-facing behavior. Read the index before driving, then use the matching feature file as the recipe.

Without `--with-pin`, the owner receives the schedule text. With `--with-pin`, the opted-in cleaner receives the offer, the confirmation, and the reminder, and only that cleaner's YES confirms the job. The approved cleaner still receives injury replies. HELP does not get a reply from this code. A drive without `--with-pin` does not text a door code. `--with-pin` texts the private door code to the approved cleaner only after the host says the guests have left, and the saved record redacts the digits. The landlord's switch is `CLEANER_CORE_ENABLED`.

## Baseline preconditions

- Repo root of this checkout, Node 20 or newer, `node_modules/.bin/tsx` present (`npm ci` when it is not).
- Default doctor and smoke do not read `TOURCORE_HOME`. A journey that says `--data` uses only that temporary directory.
- Scratch Lane recipients are only `+15555550100` (owner) and `+15555550101` (approved cleaner). `+15555550199` may be a reply sender and must not be a recipient. Scratch Court recipients are only `+15555550110` (owner) and `+15555550111` (approved cleaner). `+15555550119` may be a reply sender and must not be a recipient. A drive for one tenant must not text the other. All of these are Scratch 555 numbers. Never type a real person's number.
- Run doctor in the same flag setting as the drive and require `sends` false.
- Each command is a fresh process. Do not reuse a shell that still has `CLEANER_CORE_ENABLED` set when the recipe says unset.
- Never drive `sendblue:*` or any other live messaging script from this map.

## Driving conventions

- Start every recipe from the baseline unless its preconditions say otherwise.
- Treat every command as literal. Keep the flag assignment and the npm script unchanged.
- Flag on: `CLEANER_CORE_ENABLED=1 npm run --silent cleaner:doctor` and `CLEANER_CORE_ENABLED=1 npm run --silent cleaner:smoke`.
- Replies: `npm run cleaner:smoke -- --reply +15555550100=STOP`. Repeat `--reply` for each inbound text. A reply text that starts with `@` names a fixture file. Any explicit operation (`--reply`, `--feed`, `--then-feed`, `--google`, `--notion`, `--onboard`, `--group-mode`, `--group-capable`, `--participant`, `--tenant`, `--closed`, `--now`, `--remind`, `--fail-sends`, `--data`, `--no-poll`, `--with-pin`, `--unapproved`, `--group`, `--group-chat`, `--group-extra`, `--group-reply`, `--confirm-times`, `--resume`) does not also inject YES.
- Flag off: `env -u CLEANER_CORE_ENABLED` in front of the same scripts.
- Assert the full stdout document and the exit code. A truthy `ok` is not a result.
- After smoke, every `+1` number in stdout must be a Scratch test number: area code 555, or exchange 555 with line 0100–0199.
- A drive without `--with-pin` leaves `pinRecipients` empty. Its stdout, job list, outbox, and persisted store contain no door code. A `--with-pin` drive may list `+15555550101` in `pinRecipients`. Its saved stdout, transcript, outbox, and store replace the scratch digits with `[redacted]`.
- Do not remove proof artifacts during cleanup. A temporary `--data` directory is removed only after its stdout is saved.

## Proof and skip reporting

- Capture the command, stdout, stderr, and exit code under `.cursor/skills/verify-cleanercore/evidence/<UTC timestamp>/`.
- Record the feature id and the entry point in that directory's `result.txt`.
- Default smoke stdout is the record of texts. Step D through G journeys also save the transcript, the job list, and the outbox from that stdout.
- Report an unreachable path with the attempted command and the unmet precondition.
- Do not report a skipped entry point as verified through a different path. Flag-on smoke with no operation confirms the built-in turnover. That is not proof of STOP, a feed change, a block, or a failed send.

## Feature entry contract

Each feature file starts with an H1 title and one paragraph describing the user-visible behavior. It then uses exactly four H2 sections in this order.

1. `Sub-features` lists short IDs with one line for each behavior.
2. `How to get to it (user POV)` lists every user entry point.
3. `Driving it with the cleaner doctor/smoke CLI` starts with `Preconditions:` and uses labeled bullets that pair each user action with an exact command and observable result.
4. `Gotchas` lists traps that can waste or invalidate a verification run.
