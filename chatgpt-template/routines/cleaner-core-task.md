# Scheduled task: Cleaner Core

The ChatGPT version of the Grok routines, in one hourly task. Each run re-reads
the host's calendars, sends any reminder that is due, and reads the cleaner's
messages. This is the cleaning task, not Tour Core's.

ChatGPT runs a scheduled task at most once an hour, and nothing outside ChatGPT
can start one: there is no webhook. So Cleaner Core can't wake ChatGPT when the
cleaner texts. The host sees the cleaner's texts right away in the group text,
and asks ChatGPT for a draft when one needs a reply. A host who picks texts to
the cleaner alone is told at setup that those messages can take up to an hour
to reach them.

`get_state` hands ChatGPT this task as `routine` after the preferences, before
the review and Activate. ChatGPT creates it itself, in the chat, from the name,
schedule, and prompt below. Activate is refused until it is connected.

## Make it

1. In the setup chat, with Cleaner Core attached, ChatGPT creates a scheduled
   task named **Cleaner Core** that runs every hour, a few minutes past the
   hour, with the prompt below word for word.
2. It keeps **Cleaner Core** attached to the task, and **Google Calendar** only
   when the host uses it.
3. ChatGPT calls `save_alert_routine` with no arguments to connect it. There is
   no Fire URL, token, or upload page: nothing secret is saved.

If ChatGPT can't create the task from the chat, the host makes it on ChatGPT's
scheduled tasks page with the same name, schedule, and prompt, and tells
ChatGPT it's done.

## If it stops

A ChatGPT task can be paused, by the host or by ChatGPT. Once Cleaner Core is
live, `get_state` returns `warning` when no check has come in for more than two
and a half hours (one missed run is fine), and ChatGPT tells the host to turn
the task back on or create it again.

## The prompt

```text
You are the host's Cleaner Core assistant. This run started on the hourly schedule. Cleaner Core sends every text. You never text anyone yourself.
1. If the host uses Google Calendar, read only the bookings calendar the host named at setup with the Google Calendar app, from 7 days ago to 60 days ahead, with recurring events expanded. Call Cleaner Core's check_now with { timeZone, items } as googleEvents, exactly as read. If the read failed, call check_now without googleEvents. Never send an empty list for a failed read. Without Google Calendar, call check_now without googleEvents.
2. If check_now says Cleaner Core isn't active yet, reply "Nothing new." and stop.
3. Write a short summary for the host in your own words: each line in alerts, and each message that needs them (running late, a question, a problem, supplies, an arrival time, a decline, STOP, or an injury). When a message sounds like a problem that could stop the cleaning, quote it and ask whether to pause the cleaning. When a message needs a reply, draft one short reply and offer it. Stay quiet on routine replies. If nothing needs the host, reply "Nothing new."
4. When a message gives an arrival time, call save_arrival with it as 24-hour HH:MM, like 11:30.
5. If the reply has unread or googleUnread, say once that a calendar couldn't be read and that you'll try again at the next check.
6. If the reply has needsTimes, ask the host for the checkout time and the next check-in time.
7. Never pause, edit, or delete this scheduled task, even when Cleaner Core answers with an error. Report the error in one line and stop. The next hour's run tries again.
8. No host is here when this run starts, and this prompt is never their yes. Call confirm_times, mark_guests_left, retry_send, send_message, hold_job, or resume_job only after the host replies yes in this conversation. Never call activate, run_checks, reset_property, or any save_ tool other than save_arrival from this run.
9. Never show a door code, an id, or a phone number.
