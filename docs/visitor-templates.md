# Visitor text templates

Every outbound visitor text uses one of these ids. `{slot}` is filled before send. `{slot?}` may be empty. A channel prompt may be appended after the body. The stored template id is the body, not the prompt.

Text from the landlord or from a model reaches a visitor only as `approved-answer` or `approved-answer-closing`, and only after they approve a flagged question (`resolve_issue`). A no-draft flag never gets a draft. `approved-profile-fact` repeats a fact they already saved.

203 message templates. 7 channel prompts.
