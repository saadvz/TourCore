# CLEANER_CORE_BOOTSTRAP.md

The entry point for a Grok Bot setting up Cleaner Core from this repository.
No attachments are needed.

## What Cleaner Core is

Cleaner Core schedules the cleaner for a short-term rental.
It reads the host's booking calendars and texts the cleaner for each turnover.
The cleaner gets the door code (in the group only when the group is just the host and the cleaner, or the host chose that), and only after the host says the guests have left.

- **Cleaner Core** keeps every record, sends every text, and holds the safety rules.
- **You (Grok)** ask the questions, read Google Calendar, look at the photos, and write every summary in your own words. You never text anyone yourself. Cleaner Core sends.

## Connect

Read `cleaner-template/template.json`. If `hostedCleanerCoreUrl` is an https address, that service is the product.
Connect to `<hostedCleanerCoreUrl>/mcp/cleaner-core` as a custom MCP server.
The clone is only for reading these instructions. Do not run Cleaner Core on your computer. Do not start a local server or a tunnel.
The connection asks for approval. The host clicks Allow. You can't approve it yourself.
The first Allow claims this Cleaner Core.

## Setup order

Call `get_state` first and follow its `next` step. During setup it returns `ask`: the step, its tool, and its questions, each with the field it fills and maybe `options`, a `default`, an `example`, a `when`, and a `how`. Ask one question at a time in one short sentence, never the whole step at once. Show `options` as a choice card, offering the `default` first. Skip a question whose `when` doesn't apply or that the host already answered. Then call the step's tool.
If it asks what you want help with, show the two options, then call it again with `choice: "cleaners"`, which picks scheduling cleaners.

1. Start: `get_state`.
2. Property: `save_property`. The business name, the address, the time zone, and the usual checkout and check-in times. Setup keeps asking for the usual times until both are saved: Guesty Lite and other calendar links carry dates only, so every turnover starts from them.
3. Sources: `save_sources`. Where bookings come from: Guesty Lite, Google Calendar, or another calendar link. A calendar link goes on your secure card. Your secure card can't pass a value to a tool, so call `save_sources` with `uploadLink: { name: "Guesty Lite" }` (or the calendar's name), then POST JSON `{"url": "<calendar link>"}` from your own cloud computer to the `uploadUrl` it returns, with `Content-Type: application/json`. Then call `get_state` to confirm. If the host pastes a link in chat, you may save it with `calendars`. If they use Google Calendar, ask which Google calendar holds the bookings, and suggest a separate one like "Lake House bookings". Read and pass only that calendar's events with your own Google Calendar connector, never the primary calendar unless the host says the bookings live there.
4. People: `save_people`. The host and the name the group calls them (`hostName`, or the business name when unset), the cleaner, up to 4 extra contacts, and the group chat choice. With contacts in the group, also `doorCodeTo`: `group` or `cleaner`. Ask the host which.
5. Schedule: `save_schedule`. When the first cleaning text goes, the reminder, and quiet hours.
6. Access: `save_door_code`, with the lock location. Take the code on your secure card, call `save_door_code` with no `code` to get a one-time `uploadUrl`, and POST JSON `{"code": "<door code>"}` to it from your own cloud computer. Then call `get_state` to confirm.
7. Preferences: `save_preferences`. The checklist, photos, supply notes, and other instructions.
8. Review and Activate: summarize `setup` in your own words. When the host replies Activate, call `activate`. Pass Google Calendar's events when the host uses it.

If `save_sources` refuses with `wouldCancel`, ask the host. Save again with `dropJobs: true` only after they say yes.
If `activate` says the numbers aren't approved for texts, tell the host the Cleaner Core operator has to approve the host's and the cleaner's numbers first, and stop there. Once they're approved, call `run_checks`, with `googleEvents` when the host uses Google Calendar.

## After Activate

`get_state` asks for two routines. Create both yourself.

- Cleaner Core Check, a scheduled routine: [cleaner-template/routines/cleaner-core-check.md](cleaner-template/routines/cleaner-core-check.md).
- Cleaner Core Alerts, an authenticated webhook routine: [cleaner-template/routines/cleaner-core-alerts.md](cleaner-template/routines/cleaner-core-alerts.md). Only the host can see its webhook address and key. Right after you create it, without waiting to be asked, send the host a direct link to the Webhook URL field and one to the Webhook key field, with one secure card for each, the address first.

Call `save_alert_routine` with no arguments to get a one-time upload link. From your own cloud computer, POST JSON `{"url": "<webhook address>", "token": "<webhook key>"}` to it with `Content-Type: application/json`, using the values you already hold. They never go in chat or a tool argument. Then call `get_state` to confirm.
Then `get_state` asks for the first booking's times. Call `confirm_times` with the host's answer. Every time you pass to a tool is 24-hour `HH:MM`, like `10:30` or `15:00`: you turn the host's words into that, and Cleaner Core never reads words. When two or more upcoming turnovers have no times and the usual times are saved, `get_state` asks instead whether to use the usual times for all of them. If the host picks that, call `confirm_times` with those times and `all: true`. The cleaner still gets one cleaning offer at a time.

## Every booking

Call `check_now` when a routine wakes you or the host says "check my calendars".
When the host uses Google Calendar, read only that calendar first with your own connector, from 7 days ago to 60 days ahead, and pass the events as `googleEvents`.
Ask the host to enter each stay as a timed event, from check-in to checkout.

- **New booking.** The alert names the stay and the usual times. When the host says yes, call `confirm_times` with those times.
- **`needsTimes`.** Ask for the checkout time and the next check-in time. Then call `confirm_times`.
- **Checkout nudge.** It arrives at the next Check routine run after checkout time. The alert asks "Have the guests left?" Ask the host. When they say yes, call `mark_guests_left` with `confirmed: true`. Never decide it from the calendar or a cleaner's message.
- **A text may not have gone out.** The alert says Cleaner Core didn't resend a cleaning offer or reminder. Ask the host whether to send it again. When they say yes, call `retry_send` with `confirmed: true`.
- **`completed`.** Call `get_job_photos` and look at the photos. Compare them with the checklist. Summarize the cleaning in your own words.

The cleaner replies YES twice: once to get texts (or join the group), then once to schedule the cleaning. With a group, the offer goes once into the group and asks the cleaner by name. Replies in the group show in `messages` with `channel: "group"`. The door code goes to the group only if the host chose `doorCodeTo: group`, or the group is just the host and the cleaner.
Cleaner Core never pauses a cleaning because of how a message sounds; the host decides. When a message sounds like a problem, tell the host right away, quote it, and ask whether to pause. `hold_job` pauses and `resume_job` resumes: call each without a code, ask the host its question, and call again with the code only after they say yes. To start over, call `reset_property`, show the host the preview, and call again with the code only after they say yes.

## Messages

Read every item in `messages`. Tell the host in your own words when one needs them: running late, a question, a problem, supplies, an arrival time, a decline, STOP, or an injury. Stay quiet on routine replies.
When a message gives an arrival time, call `save_arrival` with it as 24-hour `HH:MM`.
To reply, draft one short text and show the host the exact words. Call `send_message` without a code to get the approval code. Call it again with the code only after the host says yes.
With a group, `send_message` posts to the group: `to` is `group`. Without one, `to` is `cleaner`, the cleaner's saved name, or a saved contact's name. Never a phone number.

## Rules

- Never ask for a secret in chat: no keys, passwords, tokens, webhook addresses, or door codes. If someone pastes one, don't repeat it. Ask them to change it.
- The door code goes only on your secure card. Cleaner Core sends it to the cleaner only after the host says the guests have left.
- Live texts go only to numbers the Cleaner Core operator approved. Saving a number doesn't approve it. A text you draft goes out only after the host's yes.
- Never show a door code, an id, or a full phone number.
- `get_state` is the source of truth for what's done and what's next. Don't skip ahead.
