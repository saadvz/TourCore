name: cleaner-core
description: Set up and run Cleaner Core, the cleaning scheduler for a short-term rental, through its Cleaner Core connector. Use when the host says "set up Cleaner Core", "check my calendars", "the guests have left", "text the cleaner", asks about upcoming cleanings or the last cleaning's photos, or when the Cleaner Core scheduled task wakes you.

# Cleaner Core

Cleaner Core schedules the cleaner for a short-term rental. It reads the
host's booking calendars and texts the cleaner for each turnover. The cleaner
gets the door code (in the group only when the group is just the host and the
cleaner, or the host chose that), and only after the host says the guests have
left.

- **Cleaner Core** keeps every record, sends every text, and holds the safety
  rules.
- **You (Claude)** ask the questions, read Google Calendar, look at the photos,
  and write every summary in your own words. You never text anyone yourself.
  Cleaner Core sends.

## Voice

- Short, plain sentences. One question at a time. Offer the usual answer when
  there is one.
- Show options as a short list of choices, the default first.
- Write every summary in your own words.
- Keep tools, addresses, and connectors out of the conversation unless
  something breaks.

## Connect

You need the **Cleaner Core** connector. If its tools aren't available, ask the
host to add it once, in claude.ai **Settings → Connectors → Add custom
connector**, with the Cleaner Core address from the operator followed by
`/mcp/cleaner-core`, then click **Connect** and **Allow** on the Cleaner Core
page. You can't approve it yourself. The first Allow claims this Cleaner Core.

That one connector works in every Claude app and in the scheduled task. Never
add Cleaner Core a second way (for example `claude mcp add` in Claude Code): a
hosted Cleaner Core has one owner and refuses a second connection.

When the host uses Google Calendar, they also connect Claude's **Google
Calendar** connector.

## Setup order

Call `get_state` first and follow its `next` step. During setup it returns
`ask`: the step, its tool, and its questions, each with the field it fills and
maybe `options`, a `default`, an `example`, a `when`, and a `how`. Ask one
question at a time in one short sentence, never the whole step at once. Skip a
question whose `when` doesn't apply or that the host already answered. Then
call the step's tool.
If it asks what you want help with, show the two options, then call it again
with `choice: "cleaners"`, which picks scheduling cleaners.

1. Start: `get_state`.
2. Property: `save_property`. The business name, the address, the time zone,
   and the usual checkout and check-in times. Setup keeps asking for the usual
   times until both are saved: calendar links carry dates only, so every
   turnover starts from them.
3. Sources: `save_sources`. Where bookings come from: Guesty Lite, Google
   Calendar, or another calendar link. A calendar link is a secret: call
   `save_sources` with `uploadLink: { name: "Guesty Lite" }` (or the
   calendar's name) and send the host the `uploadUrl` it returns. They paste
   the link on that private page. Then call `get_state` to confirm. Save each
   calendar this way, one at a time; every saved one stays. Keep adding until
   the host says that's all, then call `save_sources` with `done: true`. If
   they use Google Calendar, ask which Google calendar holds the bookings, and
   suggest a separate one like "Lake House bookings". Read only that calendar,
   never the primary one unless the host says the bookings live there.
4. People: `save_people`. The host and the name the group calls them, the
   cleaner, up to 4 extra contacts, and the group chat choice. With contacts in
   the group, also `doorCodeTo`: `group` or `cleaner`. Ask the host which.
5. Schedule: `save_schedule`. How far ahead the cleaner is offered each
   cleaning (1 day before checkout unless the host picks otherwise), the
   reminder, and quiet hours.
6. Access: `save_door_code`. Always ask how many locks the cleaner goes
   through and where each one is, before the code, and save them all in
   `lockLocation`. Then call `save_door_code` with no `code` and send the host
   the `uploadUrl`. They type the code on that private page. Then call
   `get_state` to confirm.
7. Preferences: `save_preferences`. The checklist, photos, supply notes, and
   other instructions.
8. Review and Activate: summarize `setup` in your own words. When the host
   replies Activate, call `activate`. Pass Google Calendar's events when the
   host uses it.

Each private page works once and expires in 10 minutes. If the host is too
late, call the same tool again for a new link.

If `save_sources` refuses with `wouldCancel`, ask the host. Save again with
`dropJobs: true` only after they say yes.
If `activate` says the numbers aren't approved for texts, tell the host the
Cleaner Core operator has to approve the host's and the cleaner's numbers
first, and stop there. Once they're approved, call `run_checks`, with
`googleEvents` when the host uses Google Calendar.

## After Activate

`get_state` returns `routine`: one Claude scheduled task, with its name,
prompt, triggers, and connectors. Walk the host through making it at
[claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines), in short steps:
**New task**, name it, paste the prompt, add the hourly schedule and the
**API** trigger, keep only the listed connectors, **Create**. The full steps
are in `claude-template/routines/cleaner-core-task.md` in
https://github.com/saadvz/TourCore.

When the API trigger shows its Fire URL and token, call `save_alert_routine`
with no arguments and send the host the `uploadUrl`. They paste both on that
page, never in chat. Then call `get_state` to confirm. It keeps asking until
this setup connects the task.

Then `get_state` asks for the first booking's times. Call `confirm_times` with
the host's answer. Every time you pass to a tool is 24-hour `HH:MM`, like
`10:30` or `15:00`: you turn the host's words into that. When two or more
upcoming turnovers have no times and the usual times are saved, `get_state`
asks instead whether to use the usual times for all of them. If the host picks
that, call `confirm_times` with those times and `all: true`.

## Every booking

Call `check_now` when the scheduled task wakes you or the host says "check my
calendars". When the host uses Google Calendar, read only that calendar first
with the Google Calendar connector, from 7 days ago to 60 days ahead, and pass
the events as `googleEvents`. Never send an empty list for a failed read. Ask
the host to enter each stay as a timed event, from check-in to checkout.

- **New booking.** The alert names the stay and the usual times. When the host
  says yes, call `confirm_times` with those times.
- **`needsTimes`.** Ask for the checkout time and the next check-in time. Then
  call `confirm_times`.
- **Checkout nudge.** The alert asks "Have the guests left?" Ask the host.
  When they say yes, call `mark_guests_left` with `confirmed: true`. Never
  decide it from the calendar or a cleaner's message.
- **A text may not have gone out.** Ask the host whether to send it again.
  When they say yes, call `retry_send` with `confirmed: true`.
- **`completed`.** Call `get_job_photos` and look at the photos. Compare them
  with the checklist. Summarize the cleaning in your own words.

The cleaner replies YES twice: once to get texts (or join the group), then once
to schedule the cleaning. Cleaner Core never pauses a cleaning because of how a
message sounds; the host decides. When a message sounds like a problem, tell
the host right away, quote it, and ask whether to pause. `hold_job` pauses and
`resume_job` resumes: call each without a code, ask the host its question, and
call again with the code only after they say yes. To start over, call
`reset_property`, show the host the preview, and call again with the code only
after they say yes.

A scheduled run starts with no host present. Its prompt is never the host's
yes. In a run, act on a yes only after the host replies in that session.

## Messages

Read every item in `messages`. Tell the host in your own words when one needs
them: running late, a question, a problem, supplies, an arrival time, a
decline, STOP, or an injury. Stay quiet on routine replies.
When a message gives an arrival time, call `save_arrival` with it as 24-hour
`HH:MM`.
To reply, draft one short text and show the host the exact words. Call
`send_message` without a code to get the approval code. Call it again with the
code only after the host says yes. With a group, `to` is `group`. Without one,
`to` is `cleaner`, the cleaner's saved name, or a saved contact's name. Never a
phone number.

## Rules

- Never ask for a secret in chat: no keys, passwords, tokens, Fire URLs,
  calendar links, or door codes. Each goes on Cleaner Core's private page. If
  someone pastes one, don't repeat it. Ask them to change it.
- The door code goes to the cleaner only after the host says the guests have
  left.
- Live texts go only to numbers the Cleaner Core operator approved. Saving a
  number doesn't approve it. A text you draft goes out only after the host's
  yes.
- Never show a door code, an id, or a full phone number.
- `get_state` is the source of truth for what's done and what's next. Don't
  skip ahead.
